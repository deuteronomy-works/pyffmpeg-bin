# pyffmpeg-bin
Same as pyffmpeg but is unserialised.
FFmpeg wrapper for python.

The beautiful thing about it is that it comes with its own FFmpeg executable. It is compressed, making it the smallest you can find. And becuase its cross-platform and python 3, it is the only option available for building cross-platform apps with ffmpeg in python.

This unserialised version means the ffmpeg binary comes with it as a binary and needs
not be built at runtime.


## Installation
    pip install pyffmpeg

## Usage
```python
from pyffmpeg import FFmpeg

inp = 'path/to/music_folder/f.mp4'
out = 'path/to/music_folder/f.mp3'

ff = FFmpeg()

output_file = ff.convert(inp, out)

print(output_file)


```

## Advanced Usage
```python
from pyffmpeg import FFmpeg
```

### Use a global directory to store all converted files
```python
ff = FFmpeg('path/to/app_folder')
ff.convert('path/to/music_folder/f.mp3', 'f.wav')
```

### Overwrite (Default is set to True)
```python
ff.overwrite = False # do not overwrite but exit immediately
```
